As I have continued working with stock data, it was suggested to me that a useful tool could be a stock back tester, where the user could put in a stock and get a 10 year back test on the stock to see if the stock generally goes up in price and may be a good investment.

Here is the opening page of what I came up with:

This is a simple and easy interface that allows the user to input the ticker symbol for a stock and see the 10 year back test. Here is an example of what is shown after a user types in the ticker symbol for Microsoft.

This chart shows us the stock's closing price over the last 10 years! I report to the user the average yearly growth and the current price of Microsoft stock.

If there is a decrease in the stock price over the 10 years then I display to the user the average yearly decrease in the stock closing price.

Now what if a company has not been around for 10 years? Well, the neat thing with the way I am pulling my stock data is that in using pandas data reader(pdr) and the get_data_yahoo function (see my October 22, 2022 post on my Interactive Stock App) does not forcibly pull the arbitrary 10 year back test date if it is not available. It will pull up to the most recent data that it has. What's cool about this is that no matter what stock is pulled I can get the first row of that dataframe (as it is in date order) and extract the date, and use that date for the rest of my backend coding. This way it will have the corect date above the output graph, and tell corectly over the last (blank) number of years, what the average yearly increase or decrease is in that stock price.

Here is an example of a stock (COIN) that has not been around for 10 years:

Sweet! See how the date at the top is starting at 2021-04-14? Also, note how underneath the graph it states that over the last 1 year (not 10 years) there has been an average yearly decrease.


This is definitely a great tool for those wanting to see if a potential company stock may be a good investment. And, it has been fun to make! Thanks for reading!

Hello everybody, in my last post I showed how we can make lists work in streamlit. In applying that to my own stock app the list worked, but I ran into this problem. An error message saying, "streamlit error: DuplicateWidgetID: There are multiple identical st.text_input widgets with the same generated key."

Now what does that mean?

After a little research I came to know that input widgets such as text input, buttons, download buttons, date input etc... (https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets) when they are created have a unique key tied to them in the backend.

I had my text input widgets assigned to a variable, and when looping through my list and running this command it was trying to duplicate the widget, having the same key, which is a no go in streamlit. I learned that you can add an additional argument to these widgets called key which sets the key of that widget.

To make this text widget, that was repeating in the loop, have a different key each time here is what I did.

I created my list and started a count variable outside of the for loop.

Inside the loop I added 1 to the count every time it went through the loop.

I assigned this changing variable as the key of my widget.

This way I do not see the DuplicateWidgetID error, as the widget now has a changing key.

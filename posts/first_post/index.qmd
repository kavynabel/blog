I have been working with and analyzing stock data pulled from yahoo finance which provides financial news including stock quotes and financial reports.

<!-- Code chunk showing how import pandas data reader and then use it to get yahoo finance data. -->

I have started learning streamlit, an open-source Python library to build an interactive stock app. I want to make an easy experience for the user to see some stock analysis.

Here are some images of what I have going so far. I allow the user to choose their stock along with the start and end dates that they want to observe.

This has been so cool to use the user inputs to display a dataframe of the stock closing price over their chosen time period and to show it in a chart!

The next item I am working on is a widget that will show the user the percentage increase or decrease of the stock over the given time frame.

For anyone interested here is a link to Streamlit documentation: https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started

    "text": "I have started learning streamlit, an open-source Python library to build an interactive stock app. I want to make an easy experience for the user to see some stock analysis.\nHere are some images of what I have going so far. I allow the user to choose their stock along with the start and end dates that they want to observe.\n\n\nThis has been so cool to use the user inputs to display a dataframe of the stock closing price over their chosen time period and to show it in a chart!\nThe next item I am working on is a widget that will show the user the percentage increase or decrease of the stock over the given time frame.\nFor anyone interested here is a link to Streamlit documentation: https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started"
